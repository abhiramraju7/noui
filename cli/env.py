"""Environment resolution for the NoUI CLI.

The CLI historically read ``TABBY_API_URL`` straight from ``os.environ`` at
import time, which meant a ``.env`` file in the repository root (the canonical
location documented in ``.env.example`` and consumed by ``backend/config.py``)
was silently ignored when running ``noui`` subcommands. The result was a
confusing setup-time mismatch: the backend would talk to the user's configured
Tabby host while the CLI kept reaching for ``http://localhost:8080``.

This module centralises that resolution. It exposes two pure helpers:

* :func:`load_env_files` populates ``os.environ`` from the repo-root ``.env``.
  It is idempotent, never overrides values that already live in the process
  environment, and is a no-op when ``python-dotenv`` is not installed.

* :func:`resolve_tabby_api_host` returns a normalised Tabby API base URL,
  applying the same default as ``backend/config.py`` and adding a missing
  scheme when callers wrote ``localhost:8080`` instead of
  ``http://localhost:8080``.

Keeping these as side-effect-free functions means tests can exercise them
without importing the rest of ``cli/main.py`` (which has substantial
import-time work).
