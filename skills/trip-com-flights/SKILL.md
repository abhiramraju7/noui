# Trip.com Flights

Search Trip.com public flight pages through Tabby `POST /execute/fetch`. Browser cookies and networking remain inside the Tabby session; never use CDP, extract credentials, or fall back to direct target-site HTTP.

Requires a HEALTHY `trip-com` profile plus Tabby API credentials.

Trip.com currently wraps in-page fetch on some public routes; surface browser-fetch failures without switching to CDP or extracting tokens.

```bash
python operations/run.py --origin "DEL" --destination "BOM" --departure 2026-08-10 --return-date 2026-08-12 --adults 1
```

Treat fares as public snapshots. Confirm baggage, fare rules, availability, and final price with the airline or provider.
